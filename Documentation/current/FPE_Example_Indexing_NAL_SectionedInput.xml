    Photosynthesis
  </Lemma>
  <Definition>
    Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light
    energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms'
    activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as
    sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.
