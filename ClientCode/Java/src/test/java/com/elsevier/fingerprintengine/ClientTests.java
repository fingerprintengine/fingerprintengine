The allantois, however, is extensive and permanent. Initially, the allantoic placenta is cup shaped but eventually flattens out to form the discoidal placenta. It is lobuliform and endotheliochorial, and probably a marked attenuation of the interhemal membrane occurs in later stages. The marginal hematoma, which is completed before the limb bud stage, is formed by enlargement and coalescence of separate extravasations, and apparently remains fully functional to term.
